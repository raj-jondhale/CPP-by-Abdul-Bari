1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,030
Now let us see where to write our programs, where to write C++ programs.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:07,920
So there are various IDs.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,300
You can use the IDs and also you can practice your programs on online compiler.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,650
So I suggest you to better use online compilers, right?

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,400
So if you face any difficulty, you can share the code and we can test it on same online compiler and

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,850
it can we can help you better.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,620
And also you can use the IDs.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,890
I will show you how to use the IDs in the next lectures.

9
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,820
If you are already using some ID and comfortable with some ID like code blocks or Def, C++ or Visual

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,200
Studio, you can use it.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,040
All right.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,010
So now I will show you where to practice C++ programs online.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:56,520
So open Chrome browser and here type online GDB online gdb.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,700
So don't select dotcom, don't select dotcom.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,120
Just give space and say C++.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,480
Don't directly go to dotcom, write online, GDB, C++.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,680
If you want to use a C, you can use C also.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,920
So enter now the first link that is online compiler and debugger for C and C++.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,970
Click on this one.

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,850
So here you are on online gdb.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,110
Right.

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,040
There's a compiler.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,980
No, you can read it in the URL.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,680
It is online C++ compiler.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,400
All right.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,710
Now, one important thing on the right hand side, on the right hand top, you can see here, C++ is

27
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,780
selected right on the right hand side.

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,250
C++ is selected.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,480
That is the reason I told you to type on GDB and C++ then.

30
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,210
In Google search it has already shown you C++ links, so we directly came here.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,080
Otherwise if you want to change the language, you can change the language.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,030
You can select other languages also like Java or C language or other languages.

33
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,520
So there are many various languages all available.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,180
So you can use this online compiler for various languages.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,740
All right.

36
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,370
But we are using it for C++, so don't touch anything.

37
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:17,930
Just leave it, because already you have selected C++ compiler and you can see that so readily available.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,570
Some piece of code is available here.

39
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,410
That is C++ code is available here.

40
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,450
So it is a hello world program.

41
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,430
It will print Hello World.

42
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,840
All right.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,690
So I don't have to type anything.

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,740
This is a sample program is already available.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,780
Just click on run.

46
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,010
It will run the code.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,420
Here it is at the bottom.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,740
It has shown the result.

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,150
That is Hello world.

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,630
All right.

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,600
Now, if you want to write something in your program, just as a sample, I will write down.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,250
Okay.

53
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,250
So later, we will be learning about this one.

54
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,180
I'm not going to explain what I am writing.

55
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,660
I just am testing it.

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:03:01,100
And two numbers then seen reading two numbers X and Y, then z, assign x plus y.

57
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,710
I am writing a program for adding to numbers.

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,740
So instead of Hello World I will just modify it.

59
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm not writing it separately.

60
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,510
Some s addition of two numbers is print z.

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,170
Now don't try to understand anything, okay?

62
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:17,780
Just.

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,920
I have written something to demonstrate that you can write any program here.

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,890
You don't have to touch anything just inside the main function.

65
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,180
Start writing a program.

66
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,610
So I have written my code in main function.

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,590
Now let us run it and see whether it will add it to numbers or not.

68
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,470
So it's asking me to enter two numbers.

69
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,200
I'll give the first number as ten and second number as 20, and the result is 30.

70
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,960
So I'm starting.

71
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,490
Yes, it is working perfectly.

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,290
So that's it, this is a better place.

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,680
Alright.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,370
And if you find there are many compilers available, online compilers are available, you can practice

75
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,280
any way you like.

76
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,060
All right, so this is the way you can practice online.

77
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,920
All right.

78
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,400
And if you want to install it in the next lectures, you will find how to install it on your machine.

79
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,020
All right.

80
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,210
So that's all in this lecture.

81
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,550
So practice programs here in online.
