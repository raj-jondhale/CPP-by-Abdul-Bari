00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:08,640
In this video, I will show you how to download Def C++, how to set it up and how to use it.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,410
So this is an ID I use for writing C++ program.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,350
Most of the students use Def C++, so let us learn how to download and set up.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,920
So open Google Chrome and Google Chrome search for download def C++ with min g w.

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,570
So already there.

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,070
I have searched for it already.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,740
So this is the thing that you have to type.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,990
Just note down, make sure you are searching for the same thing, same string download dev c++ with

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,390
min gw min GW is a compiler.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,310
So when you download dev C++ it's an ID along with that compiler will also get downloaded and installed

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,270
on your machine.

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,250
So just hit enter.

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,180
Then you'll find various links.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,250
Click on the first link that is from SourceForge Dot Net.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,410
So click on this one.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,440
Now here we are on a download page on SourceForge website.

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,960
Click on this green button.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,380
You can read it.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,320
Download latest version.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,140
Def C++ 5.11.

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,680
EDM cc 4.99.2.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,580
Setup dot x.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,250
Make sure you have reached the same link.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,790
Right.

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,670
You should read it and check you are on the same link.

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,200
Click on this one.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,960
It will start downloading after downloading install dev C++.

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,420
Okay.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,300
It has finished installation.

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:20,330
If I show you the folder where dev C++ is installed, this is in C and program files.

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,020
And here is CP.

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,550
So you can see that there is also install min GW that is GMU compiler for Windows.

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,130
This is a minimal compiler for Windows.

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,500
Let us start dev C++.

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,010
So English language selected the next then.

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,560
Okay.

37
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,660
Yes.

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,680
Def C++ is ready now.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,560
Before we start using it, we have to make some important settings and these settings we have to do

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,540
only once.

41
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,860
So let me show you what settings we have to do.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,620
Go to the menu and the menu.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:04,200
You'll find tools on the top, then select compiler options and here few tabs are there.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,490
That is the general tab.

45
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,610
Inside this mention hyphen g.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,340
This will allow the compiler or the debugger to debug the program.

47
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,620
So there's a flag for the compiler which will allow the debugger to debug the program.

48
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,970
So what is debugging and all?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,070
We will see it later in the next videos.

50
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,490
You have to mention this hyphen G or minus G, then go to another tab.

51
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,900
That is programs.

52
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,930
Here, you'll find Jesus.

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,690
So for that Jesus wrote X is given.

54
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:47,660
And this compiler by default it will be C++ 98 version, but will be using the features of C++ 11.

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,510
That is that is the later version.

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,660
So to use C++ 11, we have to mention here.

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,490
So this is what you are supposed to write, hyphen STD.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,270
That is minus STD.

59
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,900
You can delete as then equal to C++ 11.

60
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,320
Then do the same thing in the next field.

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,980
Also write C++ 11, HDC, C++ 11.

62
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,180
It can be kept a lot small C++.

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,010
That doesn't make difference.

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,830
By mentioning this now, the ID will be using C++ 11 compiler.

65
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,020
Now we are using the in our course will be we will be using the features of C++ 11 also.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,700
So if this is not mentioned, those features will not work.

67
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,290
So this is the very important thing that you have to do in the settings.

68
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,640
Now we are ready.

69
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,150
Just say, okay, now the settings are done.

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,880
Now we are ready to do any project or write over C++ programs.

71
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,930
So let me show you how to create a new project.

72
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,940
Say a new project.

73
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,260
And Select Console application.

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,410
Let the project name as my first.

75
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,240
And it should be created in documents.

76
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,610
Now the project is ready.

77
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,850
This is main door zip file inside the project.

78
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,980
So here, I'll just give a message.

79
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,600
Hello world.

80
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,890
And.

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,520
And they should use namespace for code as well as.

82
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,740
And then let us build the project and execute.

83
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,290
Now Helloworld has appeared.

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,090
So that's all.

85
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
This is how you can open a new project for every program or application.

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,870
You can start a new project or else for practicing in the same project.

87
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,190
You can go on writing new code there and you can recompile and run it.
