1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,360
In this video, we will see how to download and set up Visual Studio.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,100
So open the browser and search for download Visual Studio.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,470
The first link is from Microsoft, so click on it.

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,350
It will take you to the website, Microsoft website here.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,470
There are various versions of Visual Studio available, so you can select the first one that is for

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,470
community, and it is a free version for students and for researchers.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,390
So select the first one.

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,280
Click on free download.

9
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,790
It will start downloading.

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,640
And it will pop up and ask you to select the.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,990
Type of applications that you are going to develop while it is downloading, it will ask you to select

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,300
the type of applications that you will be developing so you can select desktop application and sign

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,600
up by entering your email ID and selecting your country.

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,760
Click on the file for installation.

15
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,730
After signup, you can start installation.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,230
Here.

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,670
The installation starts.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,160
Yes.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,230
Here it gives options for what purpose?

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:31,470
You want to download C++ so you can select desktop development with C++.

21
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,210
So select this option.

22
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,550
And click on install.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
It's and struggle.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,590
It will install Visual Studio for C++.

25
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,730
Once the installation is over, you have to restart your computer.

26
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,840
So restart it.

27
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,950
So the installation of Visual Studio has finished.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,020
Now let us start Visual Studio and develop 1/1 project.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,080
So good to start menu and here I will type Visual Studio.

30
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,860
So this is the Visual Studio 2019.

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
So click on this one.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,230
Here it started.

33
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,510
Now here, say, create new project.

34
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,680
So select this one.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,270
Right.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,380
So for every program that you write, I suggest you create a new project that is better and you can

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,800
have all the projects in one folder next.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,170
Here you have to select the type of the project.

39
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,070
So on the top left you will find here the language.

40
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,340
So select it as C++, right?

41
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,140
And the platform is Windows.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,330
Okay.

43
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,940
You need not select that one.

44
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,540
Just you can leave it as it is for all platform.

45
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,810
If you scroll down, you'll find one option that is console app.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,570
So you have to select console app, right?

47
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,650
So, so all the applications that we are going to develop are console applications.

48
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,850
So you always have to select this one, say next.

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,050
Now here you have to mention the project name.

50
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:24,210
So I'll give the project name as my first and you have to select the part so you can select the part

51
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,130
and then say create.

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,740
So project is created and here is the sample code.

53
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,100
The code is ready, so all the remain function is available.

54
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,350
So you can start typing your program here.

55
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,130
Right.

56
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,390
Already, the basic header file or the standard header file is already included.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:54,770
That is IU's stream and hello world program is automatically generated now here on the right hand side

58
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:01,850
in the solution explorer or in this window, if you expand the source file you will find this my first

59
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,540
step.

60
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,050
So this is what the file it is showing here, right?

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,560
If you want to write a program, simply, I will write one program with the three variables A, B,

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,160
C, and then assign some value and be assigned with some value.

63
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,860
Then C.

64
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,790
Assign a plus b.

65
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,530
Now I will display this value also standard CDC out.

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,650
See and also study.

67
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,600
And this will add to numbers and display them.

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,370
Now here you can see that something is underlined here with red color.

69
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,000
So this shows it's an error.

70
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,550
So this ID will help you to find the errors wherever you are going wrong.

71
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,470
So it's very programmer friendly.

72
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,190
So here actually I have given a single colon, so I should try scope resolution.

73
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,310
So double time I have to write colon.

74
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,840
So now this is perfect.

75
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,850
Now let us see how to run.

76
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:14,040
So here we can go to build menu option on the top and say build solution or build my first.

77
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,730
So this is my first build.

78
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,020
So it will be compiled and executable will be created.

79
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,590
Now for running go to debug option for running go to debug option and start without debugging.

80
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,660
So debugger, I'll be showing you in the next video.

81
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,010
So without debugging, just we want to run.

82
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,130
So you can also press control F5 for running the program.

83
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,100
So run this one now here displays.

84
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,600
Now here displays the result that is 1030, ten plus 20 is 30.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,680
And also Hello World.

86
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,380
So that's it.

87
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,140
So you can complete the program and you can remove all these comments.

88
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,440
If you don't like them, you can type all your programs.

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,300
So for every time, for every program, I suggest you to create a new project and do it and let the

90
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,140
project name be same as the program that you're doing it for.

91
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,460
If you would like to use Visual Studio, this is how you can set up and start using it.
