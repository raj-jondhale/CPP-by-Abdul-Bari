1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,730
In this section I'll be discussing some fundamentals before learning programming language get awareness

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,440
about few things if you are already aware of this.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,570
Then you can skip the section and you can go to the next section.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,750
Mostly in academics.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,330
These are the basics that are taught.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,320
So to get the awarness about the computers  so that we can understand how to use the computer means

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,360
how to write the programs.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,030
How do you utilize them best.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,010
So far that these are the basic topics that I'm going to discuss like how computer works than what are the

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,800
number systems like binary number system, octal number system.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,910
These are useful in understanding how computer works

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,830
What is the program.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,300
Why we write the program how to write the program.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,380
These are the things that we will discuss and I work the high level and low level languages compiler 

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,240
and the interpreter 

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,230
This is very important.

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,790
These differences are very very very important but then in an interview point of view it is also important 

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,830
mostly stored and cannot differentiate them properly.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,350
So I have given a very detailed comparison of these two.

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,940
Then what is an operating system little bit  about operating system.

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,270
So let us start with the topic.
