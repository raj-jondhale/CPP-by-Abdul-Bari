1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,380
And this video I'm going to discuss what does it mean by a program, why we write program  and how it is possible

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,480
to write a program.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,130
So we learn about these basic things.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,950
See in the previous videos already we have discovered that our computers can understand binary form

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,720
of language.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,530
So there are some predefined set of instructions that a processor or

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,700
CPU can understand.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,290
And we have to use those instructions for performing a task.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,880
Now what does it mean by task here.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,680
So let us understand why.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,180
Actually we need computers.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,620
What is the purpose of using computers.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,020
We use computers for performing computational task.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,900
So what does this computational task.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,240
All those tasks which are done using pen and paper.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:52,500
The computations by using formulas by using any expression we put the values and get answers so we use

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,170
various formula,  various steps.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,610
So computation work that is paper work.

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,760
So for that purpose we use computers.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,430
So that computation work can also be done using calculator.

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,980
Yes it can be done using calculator.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,530
So let us understand first how do you use a calculator.

23
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,560
And then I'll show you how we can use computers and what does it mean programming.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
We use calculator like this.

25
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,940
See for example if I have two numbers I want to add them.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,540
First  no. is 13,

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,670
And second no. is 27.

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,970
I want to add them.

29
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,580
So pick a calculator hit first number 13 and then press plus then hit second number 27.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,260
Then press equal to sign,

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,100
So I'm pressing plus sign and equal to sign.

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,120
And finally I get the answer that is 40 so you can use a calculator for adding two numbers.

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,670
A simple task so I don't need a computer for this one.

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:55,830
That next if I have a list of numbers and I want to calculate average of those numbers.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:06,280
So I'll just write on few numbers here 10 15 8 6 9 5 12 13.

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,870
So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,020
I'm adding more numbers eleven and sixteen.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,140
So I have to order 10 numbers.

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,880
I want to find average of these numbers.

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,490
Then how to use a calculator.

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,550
Now watch it.

42
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,400
I have to enter or hit 1 0 for the first number.

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,720
Then + then next number then plus the next number plus next number.

44
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,830
I have to go on adding them and that's something to be getting accumulated.

45
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,900
So finally I'll get the total of all these numbers like total is one not five for these numbers then

46
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,860
I should also have the count of numbers, total how many numbers I have? total 10 no. i have

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:55,600
that total I should divided by ten then, I get that as ten point five here calculator doesn't

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,820
know how to find the average I should know how to find the average.

49
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,780
So far finding an average I should have the list of numbers on I should go on adding them and then they

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,350
should divide them by a number of numbers and that is 10.

51
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,770
Then i get the result right.

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,320
This is not a simple operation.

53
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,190
This was a simple operation.

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,110
This is having a procedure.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,680
Yes there is a procedure for finding average.

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,770
Now similarly there is a procedure for finding the maximum number or the total number of numbers.

57
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,260
There is a procedure for searching a particular number.

58
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,270
In this list.

59
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,000
So for various things there are some procedures.

60
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,520
And if you have learned about statistics then I want to find a mean of these numbers or median of these

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,880
numbers.

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,210
So there is a procedure for that.

63
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:47,310
If you want to sort these numbers then there is a procedure so calculator doesn't know the procedure

64
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,430
means that the steps involve for completing a particular task.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,580
now how we know it.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,190
Our teachers have taught us that procedure.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,800
So we know the procedure right.

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,330
So same procedure can we teach it to calculate that itself so that just we will tell.

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,760
We want average.

70
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,420
It should ask what are the numbers.

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,770
These are the numbers. and it  should give us the result without asking us how to do it.

72
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,410
We want our calculator to be trained on this one.

73
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,050
So it means we want our programmable calculator.

74
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,680
Yes that's it.

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,150
So the extension of calculator I can see on the next level to calculate there is nothing but computer.

76
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,590
Computer is a programmable computational device.

77
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,020
We can define a procedure by giving all the steps one by one to our computer system and we call it as

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,830
a program and the program a computer system or a CPU or processor will execute those set of instructions

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,180
and give us the result.

80
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,990
So that's what is programming that's it.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,550
This is what we use computers and what is programming.

82
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,740
I have told you no more about program more detail and clear picture about a program.

83
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,590
I will give you my take on a list of numbers.

84
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,110
So these are the list of numbers.

85
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,660
Let us say the procedure the same.

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,250
I want to find an average.

87
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,710
So what are these numbers.

88
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,440
These numbers are nothing but data.

89
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,190
This is a data. then for performing average.

90
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,060
There is a procedure right.

91
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,300
So that procedure.

92
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,450
The steps involved in that one.

93
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:29,100
So those are nothing but instructions so he can say these are instructions right.

94
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,060
So there are two things now data and instructions upon that data.

95
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,130
So program is nothing but collection of data and a set of operations or instructions on that data.

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,880
So we have to focus on only two things in our programs.

97
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,250
What is the data you have and what you do want.

98
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,810
What you want to do with that data.

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,370
So what are the steps.

100
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,540
What is the procedure.

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,430
See without data

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,110
There is no need of instructions like instructions are useless.

103
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,910
And if you have just the data more instruction than you don't know the results right.

104
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,370
So these are the two important parts of a program.

105
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,080
So we have to focus on this one.

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,620
We have to learn how to represent our data and also we have to learn how to write on the instructions

107
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,160
that will execute our computer data to get that answer.

108
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,760
So this was a learning programming.

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Now one important thing for learning programming you should already know the procedure right.

110
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,590
This is the very very very important point here that most of the students get confused.

111
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,030
The thing that learning programming will make them learn procedure no learning procedures are different.

112
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,300
writing programs is different.

113
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,950
So we are going to learn two things how to write a program and how to write what a procedure right.

114
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,010
How to convert procedure into a program.

115
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,910
So a program contains a data and a set of instructions.

116
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,220
Now let us come to the computer site.

117
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,670
See this is all a machine computer machine right.

118
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:04,700
So let us say it is a CPU now this is my self, now language of CPU zeroes and ones.(binary)

119
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,880
How to represent data in that one? In the form of zeros and ones.

120
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,920
How do you present instructions.

121
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,520
That is also in the form of zeros and ones both the data as well as instructions are in the form of

122
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,440
zeros and ones that is binary.

123
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,790
Then what is my language.

124
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:29,560
My language is English language so instructions are in English and our data is also English.

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,430
Like if I if you asked me to read these numbers I would say 10 15 9 6 8 this is English, numbers are

126
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,210
also in English.

127
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,040
If you know any other language then these numbers are called by different word or different

128
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,980
names are there for them and the figures are also different.

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,170
So this is English.

130
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,990
So my data is also English and the instructions are also in English and CPU language  is machine

131
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,060
language is zeros and ones.

132
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,000
This is binary.

133
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:02,500
This is machine language and this is natural language that is human being's language.

134
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:11,080
Now we want our machine to learn our procedures so we have to learn in a machine language or we should

135
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,230
develop our machines so that they understand natural language anyone of this right now.

136
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:22,630
Either way it's not possible either way it's not possible we can't run machine language and computers

137
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,280
are not so much developed that they understand natural language no recent computers they are having

138
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,799
some artificial intelligence that are useful for pulling the data but not for programming it. for

139
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,039
programming it machine should understand natural language so this is not yet happening right then what

140
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,030
we need now we need some intermediate language so that's easy for me on so easy for machine also.

141
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,940
So that's what Here comes programming languages the programming languages that we use like C C++ Java

142
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,040
C sharp VB Python all these languages become under programming languages.

143
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,370
So we learn this language and whatever procedure are we transform them in this form

144
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,340
and these languages will help us to transform that procedure into machine language.

145
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,940
So from natural language to programming language and programming language to machine language translation

146
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,620
is a time.

147
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,410
So this translation is not there.

148
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,370
We learn it, we have to learn it right.

149
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,300
If translation is available then anybody can do programming just you say it will become a program.

150
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,700
So we have to learn a programming language and write our procedures in that language.

151
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,170
Then from this language there is something called compiler or interpreter.

152
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,620
Right.

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,410
I'll just write in short we are going to learn that in this next video compiler interpreter will translate

154
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,360
that into machine language.

155
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,630
So this is how programming languages are useful for writing programs.

156
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,140
So we should learn some programming language so that's all about what does it mean by program and why

157
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,430
you need programming.

158
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,930
Let us revise things very quickly.

159
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,650
So you started with a calculator calculator if not a programable device.

160
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,490
Now we want our machines to know the procedure.

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Just want given the data we would not know the procedure.

162
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,820
So for that we need a language so that we can write a program.

163
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,380
So what a program will contain data and a set of instructions upon that data.

164
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,910
this are the main part or ingredients of a program.

165
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,470
But this has to be written in machine language.

166
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,690
We don't know machine language.

167
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,280
So we introduce some intermediate language that is a programming language that is helpful for us.

168
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,140
And it will translate that into machine language.

169
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,900
Machine code.

170
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,580
And the program that is understandable by CPU.

171
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,920
So that's all in this video in the next few days I'll explain you what does it mean by compiler and

172
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,550
what does it mean by

173
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,560
INTERPRETER. What are the differences.

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,090
By taking few examples I'll explain them, but I have already used their name here.

175
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,220
That's what.
