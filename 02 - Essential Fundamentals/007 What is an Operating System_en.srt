00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,190
In this video I'll give you a brief introduction to operating systems there are well known operating system 

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:12,340
for formerly people use them right on their laptops or on PCs.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,000
The known operating systems are Windows.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,490
This very famous operating system and Linux.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,440
This is mostly used by professionals or this is used in companies third.

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,270
That is Mac OS X is operating system.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,850
These are the commonly found operating systems.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:38,900
So what actually an operating system is? see operating system is a master program.

9
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,120
It will utilize all the resources of your computer system and provides services to the user.

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:53,270
See these are the components in a computer system like already we have seen this CPU and the main memory

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,860
then the input and output device.

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:03,670
So I am showing keyboard mouse monitor printer and network and measurly hard disk right now.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,630
The programs are running here inside the main memory may require these very fellows

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,830
all the resources of your computer system or let us draw a

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,500
user also here.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,380
User is using computer systems.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,630
He may be using these resources like accessing internet or accessing some files and ALL.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
So program user will not directly use it.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,340
He will use them through a program only definitely.

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,940
So finally users should be benefited from the resources and the program.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,210
So this the responsibility taken by an operating system and it means the environment it provides an

22
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,290
environment easy for a user to use the computer system.

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:54,920
So even on your mobile phone you have operating systems like Android operating system and IOS operating

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,840
system.

25
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,630
So on mobile phone also it's the same thing like you have a storage and the ram that is main memory

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,310
and the processor is there.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,420
screen itself display on its screen itself works as an input or a touch

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,500
device touchscreen.

29
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:21,800
So both are similar. now let us know how operating system works. listen when you start your machine computer

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,710
PC. or mobile phone or laptop.

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,870
The first thing that you'll see is it is getting ready and if you're using Windows P.C. you will find

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,400
a Windows logo and you will get a message of starting windows starting on your mobile phone Android

33
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,050
mobile phone you will get a message at the bottom that is Android it's getting ready.

34
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,080
So the very first thing when you start your machine a device it will get ready upon operating system.

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,230
See operating system actually is present in the your storage on a hard disk.

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,550
So I'm showing it as Windows Windows.EXC like Windows is also program operating system is also program.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,100
But it gets loaded by itself so it will start by itself.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,370
The moment when you will start your machine operating system will get loaded and operating system will

39
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,000
start executing so that your hardware or your device get ready up on operating system.

40
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,180
So this should come inside main memory.

41
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,910
So I will  just write OS in short for operating system. operating system will get ready first inside

42
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,700
the main memory and the CPU will start executing that operating system.

43
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,330
So the very first thing that you get a screen that full of icons and cursor for mouse everything.

44
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,670
All this is displayed by operating system and the operating system is ready to take the instruction

45
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,820
for you or the commands from you.

46
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,500
So you click on some icon for opening an application.

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,880
So how it works.

48
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,410
Operating system running here inside the CPU will bring that program inside the main memory and it

49
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,780
will ask the CPU to execute that program.

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,660
So that program runs within the context of operating system.

51
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,650
Now it is not independent it's running as a part of operating system.

52
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:11,800
within in the control of operating system it is perfectly monitored by operating system.

53
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,060
So operating system will get our program execute

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,300
When you touch on the icon on the screen or when you double click on the icon on the screen on the PC

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,560
program will get into the main memory and an opening system will start executing it.

56
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:34,640
Now the last thing when our program is accessing a monitor or printer or network anything program cannot

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,970
directly access anything cannot directly access.

58
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,260
It has to get the work done or make a request to the operating system.

59
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,760
It has to display something on the monitor.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,230
It should ask the operating system that I wonder display this if something is typed from the keyboard

61
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
that is coming in.

62
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,620
And if a program wants that then it should ask the operating system to get that input so programs

63
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,440
cannot access the hardware directly how to handle them how to access them like multiple programs

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
may be running right.

65
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,860
So one program cannot capture the device so operating system take care of all these things so it will

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:19,420
manage the resources so everything has to be done via our operating system by making a request to operating

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,940
system.

68
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,470
So then any program any program but it is making a request to the operating system for accessing the

69
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,210
resources or getting services from the operating system then it does that by using System calls system

70
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,830
calls and we say that these are system calls or we also call it does API but system call is the right term

71
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,620
for this one. Application program interface or system called a program will makes system calls for

72
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,850
the operating system for availing services.

73
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,890
So that's all I have explained you how operating system will start on the machine and how it will help

74
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:03,610
our program execute. now in short operating system is a master program which will take all the resources

75
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:11,740
under control and provide services like you may maybe knowing us sports department or library in your

76
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,100
college like librarian will hold all the books right.

77
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,830
He has a control over all of them.

78
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,960
He has the authority to issue the book or claim the book back from a student so he decides who should

79
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,580
get how many books are not for how much period a book should be given we should given to a student and everything

80
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,530
he decides right.

81
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,030
So a better book is available or not available.

82
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,920
He knows everything so a student cannot directly go and pick up a book and take it home.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,770
He has to request to the librarian and when he is returning again he is give it back to the librarian.

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,540
So library managers library that is a sources. Same way operating system manages all the resources of

85
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,650
your computer system and the programs will use these resources with the help of operating system.

86
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,170
thatsall little bit about  an operating system so now you should know that there is something

87
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,900
called operating system also between CPU and the resources and your program.

88
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,390
Right.

89
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,810
So there are few things that are done by the operating system during run time of your program so you

90
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,660
should be aware of this.

91
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,830
So this is sufficient for about knowing about operating systems.

92
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,070
So that's all in the section in the next section we will cover a few more concepts that are very useful

93
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,670
for programming.
