1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,350
For understanding how computers works 
first of all let us look at a Block diagram

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,990
It's a very basic thing.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,330
Let us study it.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,610
See there's a blog them off your computer.

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,680
Let us see the components first of all.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,830
See this the CPU, it is having two parts ALU i.e,arthimatic and logical veiw

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,780
and control unit, CU

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,080
I'll explain they're working. The next is main memory and this is the hard disk drive which contains

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,780
the data in the form of files and this is input device like a keyboard mouse or a stylus tablet anything

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,890
then the output device like your monitor or printer and speakers.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:49,860
Now let us understand that working see the heart of the computer is the CPU that is central processing

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:58,890
unit or micro processor if you present day processor if you see that is i3, i5 ,i7 these processors.

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,280
Now this part processor will have two parts that is arthimatical and logical unit and control unit.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,690
So what is that? arthimatical and logical unit can perform arthimatical and logical operations a basic

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:20,610
operation so a computer can perform basic operations like arthimatic operations like addition subtraction

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,070
multiplication or division or modulus then under logical operations it can compare two numbers we can

17
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:38,850
compare less then greater than or equal to and also it can perform logical operations AND OR these operations

18
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,250
like this written in caps so AND and OR as well as NOT.

19
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,920
So these are the logical operations basically.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,510
So it can perform just these basic operations right then.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,150
Second is CU control unit C there are other things connected like Hard Disk Drive and the main memory

22
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,180
input device and an output device for controlling all these things.

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,990
Controlling means utilizing them so for that it is having a separate portion that is called control

24
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,430
unit.

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,640
So its job is to utilize other resources.

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,170
This is about processor now.

27
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,410
Next thing let us start from here.

28
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,850
This is hard disk hard disk will contain files and those files maybe two types.

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:38,290
Either program files or data files like if you take a example a notepad on your P.C. is a program

30
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,880
file when you open notepad.

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,690
It's a program.

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,280
So there is a file available

33
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,450
Basically we click on some icon and then the program will start.

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,390
But if you look into my computers and folders and some where you will find a program for notepad and

35
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,900
its name file name will be notepad.exe

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:05,470
if you search for It you can find this file there's a program file Now inside notpad if you type something

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,920
and save then it will be saving it as a text file so you may be saving as my.txt file

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,200
right

39
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,460
So this is a program file and this is a data file.

40
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,740
This data file is used by notepad or generated by notepad.

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,760
So finally hard disk contains two types of files program files and data files.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,370
If you have audio files or music files or video files all those comes under the data files and if you have

43
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,070
a music player like VLC player or media player those come under the program files.

44
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:49,850
So we save our programs kept inside hard disk and that is permenant storage this will be larger in size.

45
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:57,640
The next if suppose we want to run any program then that program should be present inside the main memory

46
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,350
so that CPU can execute it.

47
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,630
So the program is brought from the hard disk to the main memory.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,540
It is brought from hard disk to the main memory.

49
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,160
So this is a working memory.

50
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,790
Our primary memory or work space.

51
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,079
So programs should be brought here.

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,430
Then CPU can execute the program by taking instructions.

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,880
Line by line for whatever the programs we run they are brought here inside the main memory right.

54
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:34,930
Then if a program needs to some data from keyboard or it has to display something on the monitor then

55
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,160
it can utilize this input devices or output devices.

56
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,680
So the program may be taking something from keyboard or remember taking something from Internet or maybe

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,350
reading something from the file.

58
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,920
So if program needs to some data it would be getting it from here.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Whatever the result is generated by the program or interactivity provided by a program that you can

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,510
find it on the output device like monitor or if any output for it is printed on the printer and these

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,000
input and output devices are connected to the system and they have the own memory like I'm sure you'd

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,540
like this.

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,810
This is the memory belongs to input device and this memory belongs to the output device.

64
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,710
So this I will call it as input buffer this is a buffer.

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,870
this the memory and similarly that is output buffer this is output buffer.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:30,550
So if a program has to read something from the keyboard so it will go to memory area and get the data

67
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,280
from there.

68
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,730
I think it has to be something on the monitor then whatever it has to print it will put it in its memory

69
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,400
area called s buffer, output buffer.

70
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,070
It's not that program directly go and print something on the monitor it will dumb everything inside

71
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,630
the frame that is the frame buffer or output buffer.

72
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,450
And that will appear on the screen now same way whatever typing from the keyboard that will go and fall

73
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,500
inside the buffer it directly doesn't enter into the program.

74
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,350
It will go on and fall into the buffer and the program can read the contents from the buffer so there's

75
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:11,260
a communication point for the device and a program running inside the in memory now.

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,420
So that's it.

77
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,100
One of the important thing we have understood how they work altogether.

78
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,880
So once again I repeat quickly the programs are here.

79
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,220
They have to be brought into the main memory for execution and CPU will execute them by executing instructions

80
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,160
line by line.

81
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,070
And if program requests for interactive interact with the user and users input and output devices.

82
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,400
Now we will learn how that CQ works how that works.

83
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,440
How it understand what does it mean by instruction how can it understand instruction.

84
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,140
So for this let us start from the basics.

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,900
See computer works on the binary number system.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,090
What is binary system. why it  works on binary system, see it's an electronic device.

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,880
So it works on current or voltages

88
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,650
so voltages are trickally or logically used as a binary.

89
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,670
How, a low level voltage is taken as zero and high voltage is treated as one.

90
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:19,520
So it is just like if suppose you have a bulb, this a bulb right, this bulb can be OFF or a bulb can be

91
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:28,360
either ON, if it is ON then we treat it as one if it is OFF we treat it as zero, that's all. 

92
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,080
Now if you have seen electronic circuitry like I/C, I will draw it here.

93
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,060
If you look at the electronic circuitry like this an I/C, right integrated circuit.

94
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,330
It is also called as a chip.

95
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,300
You can see the photograph also, here I have taken the same example.

96
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:55,830
Now just on the integrated circuit it is having pins here, these are pins this is electronic right now.

97
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,200
Through out these pins we can pass some voltages right.

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,200
Some voltage. 

99
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,610
So in this one particular pin we can pass either low voltage or we can pass high voltage. Low voltage

100
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,320
means zero and a high voltage is one.

101
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,660
Now this it maybe taking in and storing it or it maybe moving it sending it out through this other pin the

102
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,360
other end for how it works and all we don't have to go in detail just we have to focus on binary form

103
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,360
right.

104
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,570
So this one pin can be can be either zero or one.

105
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,690
Right.

106
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,490
So only two possibilities are there.

107
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,230
So that's how this is binary.

108
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:37,120
So we say does that binary number system and we call this as one bit, we call it -- one bit.

109
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,169
So this is.

110
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,580
bit. Then if I count one two three four five six seven eight eight bits are there.

111
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:50,970
So this together 8 bit, we call it as one byte. So 8 binary bits.

112
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,000
Now all of these bits are zeros means with the low voltage

113
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:03,030
So this is 0 0 0 0, this is 0 or all those eight bits are zero but only the last bit is one.

114
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,750
So this will be like this or some are zeros and some are ones.

115
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,220
Right.

116
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,570
So there can be many combinations now eight bits together.

117
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,870
These are forming this pattern.

118
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,620
They can form various backgrounds now each pattern of bits we can take it as an instruction. 

119
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:30,470
Pattern of bits of that is in binary form and we can take it as an instruction how it is treated as instruction

120
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,830
I'll explain I'll remove this and explain you. See if there is one bulb then that a bulb can be either

121
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,050
on or off.

122
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,210
Now if you look at traffic signals and if you consider only one bulb there usually will have three different

123
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,960
lights.

124
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,020
Let us assume there is only one bulb.

125
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,570
that bulb is for only two things.

126
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,460
It can be used only for two things.

127
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,310
The bulb is off means you should stop or it is on means you can go. or in other way

128
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,660
If you say no, no if it is on means you should stop and off means you should go.

129
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,180
Whatever it is ,whatever you like.

130
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,400
You can set it so we can set the rule and you can communicate with the people that this will be the

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,020
code 

132
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,150
That will be followed.

133
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,860
There will be only one bulb.

134
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,480
And if it is on means you can go.

135
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,300
It is off means

136
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:23,120
You should stop. Like this we can use this type of codes at many places like suppose Oh Officer

137
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,390
is there in his office.

138
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,310
So bulbs on means he's there.

139
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,300
If it is off he's not there. right? or if a shop is there.

140
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,780
Bulbs is on means shop is open. If bulb is off then

141
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,980
Shop is closed.

142
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,750
Like this.

143
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,510
This gives some message this gives the codes so.

144
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,720
Same thing.

145
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,530
Electronic circuitry is having voltages zeroes or ones means on and off using these voltages.

146
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,930
we can make some communication.

147
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,110
So one bulb can give you two messages right.

148
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,690
Go.

149
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,090
Or stop shop is open or closed like that.

150
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,570
If you increase the bulbs.

151
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,970
So let us take two bulbs if you have two bulbs then what are the combinations possible with the two

152
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,390
bulbs both the bulbs are off.

153
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,060
Right.

154
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,280
or these bulbs on.

155
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,900
or this bulbs on or both are on. so it means

156
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,990
This is giving four different messages, four different messages two bulbs can give you together four different

157
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,560
messages.

158
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,050
So if you have to communicate four things with the people then you can have two bulbs and you can set

159
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,270
them on and off and you should already educate the people and say that this means this.

160
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,890
This means that and so and so. like example in an examination if it's a multiple choice question paper.

161
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,020
Now students want to copy them.

162
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,940
Now if one of the person knows the answer so he can communicate to others for that they already said the codes.

163
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,720
Like if I scratch here it means option A, if I do it like this, rub my eyes, then it is option B.

164
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,600
Like that they can set the codes beforehand they set the codes and they can understand it in the examination

165
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,900
hall.

166
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,020
So same thing.

167
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,860
Now similarly we can use two bulbs for giving more messages.

168
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:11,020
So if there are three bulbs then what, if there are three bulbs just unscrambling so 0 0 0 people

169
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,270
how many possibilities are there.

170
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,990
So this is two power three eight possibilities are out there right.

171
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,480
So it means what about four bulbs.

172
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,640
If you have have four bolts then this is two power four sixteen.

173
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,390
And what if we have eight bulbs.

174
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:35,710
So eight bulbs will be two power eight that that is 256 so we can have different 256 different commands

175
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,450
two fifty six different messages messages.

176
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,790
So that's it.

177
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,860
So the computer system works on binary number system.

178
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,100
This bulbs are nothing but the pins.

179
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:54,160
And If suppose there are eight pins like this on I/C so it is just eight now each pin you assume

180
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,170
that it's a bulb.

181
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:01,210
And that can be on and off total eight pins can have different commands like 256 different commands.

182
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,430
So messages are commands.

183
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:11,700
So in the same way this CPU was also built up on messages that are in the form of binary that is low voltage

184
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,720
or high voltage that is on and off.

185
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
We'll see more on this one.

186
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:22,150
I'll remove this and discuss further. So now that we can say that the language of computers is binary they

187
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,620
understand binary language that is in the form of zeros and ones that is low voltage or high voltage.

188
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,710
So all the instructions and the data everything should be in the form of binary so of language of

189
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:39,720
the CPU is binary so how it perform arithmetic and logical operation it performs operation on binary number

190
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,320
system.

191
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,320
So that I can see that the language of machine or the computer is binary but we understand the decimal

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,430
number system.

193
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,580
We are not comfortable with binary  number system we preffer working in the decimal number system.

194
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,750
So in combination with the decimal number system How it is equal to binary form.

195
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,470
Let us look at it a little bit.

196
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,270
See in decimal number system we have the digits from 0 1 2 3.

197
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,930
So on to 9 we use these digits to form a number but then in the binary number system there are only two numbers

198
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,470
that are zeros and ones.

199
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,540
So anything we want we want to understand in the form of decimal.

200
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,390
So in decimal form if it is zero then it is binary also zero if it is one then it is also one then

201
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:33,270
in decimal it is two when in binary it is 1 2 and 3 is one 1 1, 4 is  1 0 0 ,5 is 1 0 1 and so on.

202
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,300
So this is the binary form of these decimal numbers not based on decimal number system we understand

203
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:50,200
that this CPU You or the arithmatical and logical unit perform operations so ignores the instructions

204
00:14:50,530 --> 00:15:02,830
ignores commands like zero means add suppose like assume that zero means add the two numbers one means

205
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:10,450
subtract two numbers two means multiply them like this they are forming instructions so there are some

206
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,480
predefined instructions that are there inside that circuitry electronic circuitry and that is logically

207
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,150
designed to work on commands. so the commands that we already know we have seen that it can perform arithmatic

208
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:28,360
and logical operations those operations are given in the form of codes and it already knows that which

209
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,200
command means what I have to do and we write the programs in the form of binary so the programs must be present

210
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,480
inside the main memory in the form of binary so each line of program that is an instruction it will

211
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,540
CPU will take an instruction and execute it because it already knows what it has to do for which code.

212
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:52,580
For like these becomes the codes as instructions for performing specific instruction.

213
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,660
So if you study some machine language or low level language of computer system you can understand that

214
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,320
its instructions are in the form of binary right.

215
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
So that's all we end here.

216
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:11,120
The conclusion of the talk is how computer works computer works on binary number system right.

217
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,300
And why they work on binary system because they are based on electronic and in electronic signal are

218
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,000
either zero or one that is low or high.

219
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,900
So that how everything is built up on binary.

220
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:28,330
If we don't understand binary number system so to know how it is related to a decimal system we should

221
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,310
understand some number systems in the next video we will discuss about number systems.
