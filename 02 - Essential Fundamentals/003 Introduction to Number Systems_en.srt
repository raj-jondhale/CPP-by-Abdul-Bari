1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,320
So the previous video we have learned how computer works there I have told you that computer works on

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,240
binary system that is zeros and ones or on and off but we understand decimal number system.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,200
And also I told you that the code so that its numbers can be used codes for giving instruction or

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,290
data or message.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,310
See I'm just going to give the introduction to the number system but there some topic details, how their

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,950
conversion from octal to binary and so many conversions of it.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,710
If you want to learn that it's mostly required in academics if you want to learn that there is a

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,170
section called miscellaneous you have to go to that section and study in detail about the conversion.

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,330
So the videos are available there. Here and this video, just I don't want to waste your time I don't want

10
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,500
to go in detail right now.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,400
So just I'll give you introduction to

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,090
Number system.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,400
So let us look at. See basically we use decimal system in decimal the pictures

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,760
or figures are symbols are from 0 from 9 total 10 symbols we have. then computer works on

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,690
zeros and ones.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,910
So how many symbols only two symbols.

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:17,950
So binary number system have only two symbols 0 and 1 that's all see one thing I'll tell you once

18
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,590
we have finished with the last symbol after nine we used a combination of symbols we write .

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,950
Ten, after that we write 10. 10 means to zero and one we are combining one and zero.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,180
So this place has one.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,110
The next place again will start from zero one two three.

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,820
So we have finished with the symbol.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,020
So that's why we're taking combination of symbol.

24
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,470
So same way we have only o and 1, then what is the next number , it is is 1 0.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,510
We have to take the combination.

26
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,670
So don't read it as 10, read it as a 1 0 in binary form.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,780
That's it.

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,100
So I have some numbers here.

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:04,360
Just look at them zero in binary former 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 1 0, 3 is 1 1, 4 is 1 0 0, 5 is 1 0 1.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:11,280
So on ,up to 16 I have written. if you want to be strong in the concepts of programming you want to

31
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,220
study it in detail very minor things you should know these numbers.

32
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,460
So some of them you should remember some of them should be quickly able to convert them so that I have

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,210
explained in miscellaneous videos that you can learn it next.

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,690
What is this.

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,590
octa and hexa, remembering a number in 0 0 1 1 1.

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,400
its too tough

37
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,890
We need a simple method.

38
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:42,370
So what people have done to make this a simple octal is introduce so you can take three digits of a

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,420
binary number and convert it to octal. no even this also less so they have introduced hexadecimal

40
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,630
means six plus 10 hexadecimal total 16.

41
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,560
So 0 to 9.

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,750
Then after that for10 English Alphabet A which is used that b c d e f last.

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,430
So there are

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,850
Total 16 digits in this one,  figures in this one,

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,230
symbols in this one.

46
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,870
Then after that we take combination 1 0, so how to convert this into this one this to octal

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,170
binary to hexa

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,460
Everything is there you can study it.

49
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,440
But in this video I'll just show you conversion from the decimal to binary then binary back Back to decimal 

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,430
just to give you the idea.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,890
So let us take an example.

52
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,490
I have a number decimal number base 10 means it is decimal number.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,440
So this is bas 10 and this is base 8.

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:43,030
This is Base 2 and this is base 16 so we write 10 here because 25 can be there in Octal also hexa also

55
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,370
which one it is? Now to show that we will say decimal as ten.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
then how to convert into binary.

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:58,620
So the method is we'd find out successively divided by two to get the binary form two ones twoes, two twoes

58
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:11,320
So 2*12=24 reminder is 1, 2* 6=12 reminder is 0 and 2*3=  6 remainder 0, 2 *1=2 remainder 

59
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,250
is 1.

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,800
So we take remainder here.

61
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,160
We don't play decimal 2*0 times 0.

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,329
Remainder is 1.

63
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,820
So take the digits from bottom to up.

64
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,220
So the digit side 1 1 0 0 1--- 1 1 0 0 1.

65
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:34,840
This is the binary form. so this is how a decimal number is converted into binary. Then a binary back

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,910
to the decimal.

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,630
Let us see the procedure.

68
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:45,020
If I take the same number and convert into decimal form so take the number in the boxes one two

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,030
three four five.

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,450
So I need five boxes.

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,550
Then write this number.

72
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,530
1 1 0 0 1.

73
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:01,650
Then, at this bottom, write from right side 2 power 0, 2 power 1, 2 power 2, two power 3, 2 power 4

74
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,970
4.

75
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:13,750
Now 1 * 2^4 + 1*2^3 +0*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0

76
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,020
...

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,330
This is how much 16 + 8

78
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,360
+0, (multiplied by anything is 0 only 0 multiplied by anything is 0)

79
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
This is 1 for how many this is twenty four plus 1 So this is twenty five.

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,070
So we got this in twenty five.

81
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,700
That is no. system decimal system.

82
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,840
So this how the conversion is done.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,930
So that's it.

84
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,310
This is sufficient.

85
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,010
I have shown you the decimal number in binary and binary back to decimal so like this procedure are

86
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,610
used for converting them using pen and paper.

87
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,290
Now electronic circuitry internally handle these things. right? For humans.

88
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,990
We follow this conversion methods to understand how it is represented in binary form.

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,640
So knowing no. system will definitely help you right.

90
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,830
Give you detailed understanding but associated with some other subjects are also there.

91
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,400
So in other subjects it will be very helpful.

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,130
Right.

93
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,860
That's all about no system.

94
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,360
See the coming video based on the concept only right.

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,510
So you have to be calm and follow each and every video.

96
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,970
If you are beginner then don't skip any video right.

97
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,870
I'm not going to directly start showing you how to write on the program. first you should have some

98
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,520
basics.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,570
If you're learning programming for the first time study all these, watch all this video and you will be

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,700
prepared for understanding programming.

101
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,870
All right.

102
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,940
So watch the next video.
