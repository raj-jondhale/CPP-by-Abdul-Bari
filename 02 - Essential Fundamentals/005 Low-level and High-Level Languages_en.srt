1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,900
So in the previous video I have already explained you that we talk or we understand natural

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:13,440
language human beings and machines have their machine language and that language is in binary that is

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,550
zeros and ones.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:14,940
Right.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,300
So it is in the form of zero & ones.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,270
we say this is binary language. binary language we can call it does machine language, machine

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,350
language.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,910
So that is termed as low level language, low level language. machine language is low level. low level

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,610
means actual machine's language we can't understand it.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,370
So when the machines were introduced initially it was very difficult for people to write the program

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,300
so it was not common.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,290
Machines were used in laboratories.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,500
It was not used by masses or it was not available at consumer level.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,720
So at that time so the people who develop they used to learn something from this machine code and they

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,890
used for everything in machine code form that was very tough and it was very initial stage and then

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,680
later they thought like there should be some attempt to make it easy so they introduce some language

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,230
called assembly language, assembly language.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
So this assembly language was a little easier than binary right.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,900
So this is nobody can think of working on it, except the one who has to manufacture the machine. Now assembly

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,520
language it was little easy.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,630
It can be taught and it can be learned and it can be practiced and used for writing the program.

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,710
So this was a use for some time right.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,500
And this became a base for conversion from this language to machine language.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,050
So still that is also low level language it's very difficult for learning if suppose a class of 100

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:46,050
student and if somebody is teaching assembly language then there's the chances of learning one student

26
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,330
learning it right.

27
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,930
So the learning curve is very high and it's very difficult.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,720
Like other parts of academic students learn it for some time and they finish the exam and forget it.

29
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:03,670
So anyway we don't have to use it if at all you want to work in systems programming that you want the

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,479
right operating system level programs and on then you need to learn about it right.

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,130
So I'll give you idea on that one where this assembly  language is useful if if at all you needed

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,720
then this is also low level so under low level.

33
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:25,590
We have two languages, under a low level that is machine language and assembly language machine language

34
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,730
and assembly language.

35
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,300
In short I'm writing. As this was also difficult.

36
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,400
We wanted some English like language so English like languages are high level languages they are not

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,350
exactly like English and they are not more like machine code right.

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,060
So they are in-between.

39
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:51,270
So that is easy for easy enough for anybody to learn so that are high level languages.

40
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,360
So there are a  n no. of of high level languages lots of high level lang. are out there like present day

41
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,090
we are using language like i will name them.

42
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:14,790
So these are easy to learn right high level languages C C++ Java Python C sharp visual basic Visual

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,460
C++ and the list goes on.

44
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,260
There are various languages.

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:20,970
Right.

46
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,460
So these languages we call them as programming languages because we can program and we humans

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,530
can program them.

48
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,610
Actually this assembly language is also programming language that is low level programming language

49
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,410
and these are high level language.

50
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,290
So we are much familiar with this language.

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,090
So these are really easy to learn.

52
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,270
No doubt for a beginner it is tough in the beginning but when you are used to learn when you learn any

53
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,940
one of the languages sufficient you can learn all of the languages you should learn one language thoroughly

54
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,940
then you can understand all other languages they are on the same patterns now.

55
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:04,200
And one more thing about this these languages we can categorise them as compiler based languages and

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,200
some are interpreter based languages and some are hybrid languages.

57
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,730
What are these.

58
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:12,990
We will understand next video.
