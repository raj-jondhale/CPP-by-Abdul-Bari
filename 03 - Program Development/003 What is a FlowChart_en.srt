1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,740
in this Video let us talk about flow charts. flow charts where used at the time and monolithic programming

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,330
was there than later on than when procedural programming came the usage of  flow charts was

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,740
little redused.

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,610
and today.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,930
We are following object oriented programming or aspect oriented programming so the usage of flowchart

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,990
is very much less so what does a flow chart flow chart is used for showing the flow of control of a

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,460
program.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,680
How the program is flowing.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,170
What are the steps it is performing.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,070
One by one.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:46,400
So if a program is very big it is hard to figure out how the flow of a program is so flow chart is useful

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,280
for understanding the program, instead of 

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,620
One is reading the program and understanding.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,360
He can see the flow chart and understand how the program is working.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,810
It is just like if you talk about electrical wiring in a home.

16
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,269
Then from there the wires or the cables are moving through the walls.

17
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,490
If you have a plan then you can know where exactly they are flowing and where are the important points.

18
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,420
Everything you can know.

19
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,040
Otherwise if there is any problem in the wiring then you have to dig the whole wall.

20
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,350
You have to dig the whole wall to find out

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,350
The problem is there is a proper plan.

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,540
Then you can understand.

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,860
So before laying the wire so pulling the wires we will make a plan.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,030
So same way before writing the program we make a flow chart right.

25
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,160
So based on the flow chart we write the program.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,900
So this will help you understand the program.

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:49,010
Now next usually when we are using flow chart the program as a scene as three steps: input, process and

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,270
output.

29
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,540
We call it like this.

30
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,270
First it takes some input.

31
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,100
Then it will process.

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,670
Then it will give output.

33
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,600
So any procedure you take it will have the similar steps like I was talking about a recipe preparing

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,530
a dish.

35
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,070
Input is the ingredients.

36
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,770
That process is the process of making a dish and output.

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:20,450
the dish is ready. if you take a chemistry experiment our chemistry experiment that is done usually in laboratories

38
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,140
will have input means chemicals and the vessels or instruments for whatever you need.

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,460
Then the process what you will do with that then it gets the desert.

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,030
So every procedure will have these 3 things so program also used to see like this.

41
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,660
Now for that program.

42
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:41,350
We draw the flowchart Now let us look at the elements of the flow chart.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,220
This is a pictorial representation.

44
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,700
So picture are there for representation.

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:53,000
This ellipse is used for start and stop and this is for taking input as well as output.

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,780
And this is for processing and this is condition.

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,320
And this shows flow of control.

48
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,160
Now draw a few flow charts and show you gives you the idea how flow charts are used and how they are

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,630
useful for writing the programs. flow chart for adding two numbers.

50
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,070
See first of all a flow chart starts.

51
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,580
This is a start then for finding addition of two numbers.

52
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,730
We need two numbers.

53
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,380
So that is input.

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:31,700
So we need input so we can give a message usually give the message that print Enter two numbers.

55
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,290
So does a message usually we write that because we are writing a program program should be interactive.

56
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,790
So for that purpose right.

57
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,910
Then read 2 numbers.

58
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,390
So we read them in variables.

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,770
A and B.

60
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,880
This is input.

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,990
Now we have two numbers and variables and b then next step is process so processing that we have to

62
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,350
do.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,070
We have to add a and b and stored the result in C this is processing.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:05,910
We have the result in c now so output, display the output so print sum as

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,220
c that's all end of the procedure.

66
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,160
that is a stop.

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,420
So does that end a flowchart.

68
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,920
So how it's going to work first it in input then it will perform addition then it'll give the output

69
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,660
then it will stop.

70
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,910
So this shows the flow of control.

71
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,860
These lines are showing the flow right.

72
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,970
These lines are showing flow there's a simple example.

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,440
The next example I will draw a flow chart for finding a greater number.

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,100
If you have two numbers then which one is the greater we will find out.

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,810
So in that till here it will be same  we need to take two numbers.

76
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,680
Then from a and b you'll find out which one is greater.

77
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,910
Whichever one is greater.

78
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:57,410
We will print that greater number so I'll remove this and modify this one so here flowchart starts and

79
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,930
it will take two numbers.

80
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,190
Now we don't know which number is greater.

81
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,590
So then we have to check with the condition that if a is greater than B The A is greater.

82
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,090
Otherwise B is greater so for a condition we can use this symbol.

83
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,780
So here I will draw condition box.

84
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,570
So here I can check if A is greater than B if it is a true.

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,550
Then we will print A if it is a false and then we will print B.

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,880
Now here there are two branches.

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,490
True or false.

88
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,830
So I will take two branches first one.

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,270
Let us take it as true, if this is true.

90
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,010
And second one if it is false.

91
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:48,470
So if it is true then we will print a value a print a simply I will say A then here false print.

92
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,020
B if it is not then print B then what to do after this.

93
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,380
That's all it is over.

94
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,700
So this is over.

95
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,800
Then finally it has to stop.

96
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,280
Right.

97
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,430
So this will flow and come here and this will join at this point.

98
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,110
So this will also stop.

99
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,690
So this all we can use a condition box if a is greater than B true then print a false means.

100
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,460
B is greater.

101
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,810
So print B so we can look at this one.

102
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,460
Now we will see one more flowchart for printing numbers from 1 to 10.

103
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:29,750
So I will remove this and draw flowchart for printing numbers from 

104
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,440
from 1 to 10.

105
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,430
So for printing we have to do two things one is print.

106
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:45,440
Second is count like 1 print, 2 print and 3 print so counting as well as printing two things we have to do so keep

107
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,970
in mind.

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,580
i will draw it let us start this as a starting point of a flow chart.

109
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,990
Now next we have to take any input.

110
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,370
No.

111
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,050
We already know what we have to print numbers from 1 to10.

112
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,890
So there is no input than initially we should have some counter for counting as we are printing

113
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,600
from one onwards.

114
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,710
So we need something starting from 1 onwards.

115
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,390
So for that we take a counter.

116
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,020
So this is a process so in processing we will take i.

117
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,860
That is initially it is one for first time.

118
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,560
it will be 1 so we will be printing it right now.

119
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,860
Next we will print this one.

120
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:29,300
So print means output so print i, so first time it will be printing one next.

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,500
After this I should change it to 2.

122
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,130
If it is one then it should increase by 1.

123
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,680
So how to increase it by 1.

124
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,540
So this is again a process.

125
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,240
It is not input output.

126
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,470
So whatever I value is in that add 1and store the result in i

127
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,460
So this will increase the value of i by one in the next I have to print again.

128
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,770
So again print and again increase again print and again increase how long.

129
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,240
As long as I is less than or equal to 10.

130
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,970
So is I equal to 10 now or is it less then.

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,290
Yes it is less than, so how to  check.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,470
Checking condition box.

133
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,790
So here again we need a condition box.

134
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:21,930
So here inside this condition what we will check if i is less than or equal to 10.

135
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,940
If yes we will print the again and increment.

136
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,660
So if yes that is true, if this true then go here again start.

137
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,039
So this is like a loop.

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,830
This like a loop it will go there and again start and go there again stop how long it will be go on

139
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,340
repeating as long as this is true how long that is true.

140
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,840
If I is less than or equal to 10 so when I becomes eleven we should not print so false if it is a false

141
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,470
means.

142
00:08:51,650 --> 00:09:02,290
This is false we should stop ,this  is stop so that's all the flowchart for printing numbers from

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,430
1 to 10.

144
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,030
This is how flow charts values in early days of programming but still in academic.

145
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:15,620
So this is being used this is being taught initially but it is not much useful later on.

146
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,230
But initially for understanding programming this is little helpful.

147
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,750
So that's all about the flowchart and next video we will see what are the steps involved for writing and

148
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,760
compiling and executing a program.

149
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,970
So step four development and execution of a program.
